# Introduction

### JavaScript was initially created for client-side webpages but it can now be used for several others including server-side and any device with the JS engine. #AJ90JS

### JavaScript is made up of 3 main parts viz:
- ECMAScript - core functionality of JS
- DOM(Document Object Model) - interactivity with web elements.
- BOM(Browser Object Model)- Browser interactivity. #AJ90JS


# Day 2 of 90
# Today's focus will be writing my first JavaScript code again.

## There are three ways to achieve this;

1.	The console tab of your web browser:
    i.	Open any web browser of your choice. (e.g Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome)
    ii.	Right click on any blank area and select “Inspect” or click the F12 button.
    iii.	Click on the console tab
    iv.	You can write and run your JavaScript there.

2.	With Node.js:
    i.	Download and install the latest version of node.js
    ii.	Download and install an IDE/text editor (e.g Visual Studio code).
    iii.	Create a new file with .js extension. (eg. Script.js)
    iv.	Write your code inside the file created.
    v.	If you are using VsCode click Ctrl + ` or open your terminal/command prompt.
    vi.	Navigate to your file location and type node filename.js ( e.g. node Script.js)  click enter to run the code.

3.	Creating Web pages:
    i.	Download and install an IDE/text editor (e.g. Visual studio code).
    ii.	Create two files with  .html   and  .js  extensions respectively.
    iii.	In your html file, add a  <script></script> tag preferably before the closing body tag.
    iv.	Add a  src  attribute to your script tag and link your  .js  file.(<script src="file.js"></script>)
    v.	Open the html file with a browser to run your JavaScript code. You can check for errors in the browser console.
